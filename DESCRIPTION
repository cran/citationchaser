Description: In searching for research articles, we often want to 
  obtain lists of references from across studies, and also obtain lists 
  of articles that cite a particular study. In systematic reviews, this 
  supplementary search technique is known as 'citation chasing': forward 
  citation chasing looks for all records citing one or more articles of 
  known relevance; backward citation chasing looks for all records 
  referenced in one or more articles. Traditionally, this process would 
  be done manually, and the resulting records would need to be checked 
  one-by-one against included studies in a review to identify potentially 
  relevant records that should be included in a review. This package 
  contains functions to automate this process by making use of the 
  Lens.org API. An input article list can be used to return a list of 
  all referenced records, and/or all citing records in the Lens.org 
  database (consisting of PubMed, PubMed Central, CrossRef, Microsoft 
  Academic Graph and CORE; <https://www.lens.org>).
